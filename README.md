*Training process: solver_final_robust.py.(Supprots dataset in .npy form.)

*Validating process: solver_inference_single.py (Now supprots only single sample input, in .npy form.)

*(dataset_500DOE_aid as training&test set of 500 samples from HFSS, and dataset_1sample as the validation set with only 1 sample.)
